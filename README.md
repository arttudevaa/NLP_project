## Project info
This is the deliverable for course Natural Language Processing and Text Mining. The jupyter notebook contains all the code for the project but it is not neccessarily recommended to run the notebook as it will take over an hour and you need to have SentiStrength.jar file and SentiStrengthData. If you still want to run the notebook further instructions are found in the notebook.
